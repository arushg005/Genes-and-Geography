# For this project the analysis plan is as follows:
1. Identify geographic clusters of genetic variations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
2. Visualize allele frequency distributions on a world map.
3. Study correlations between environmental factors (e.g., climate) and genetic diversity.
4. Use statistical methods or machine learning to find patterns.
