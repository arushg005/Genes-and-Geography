# Purpose of this assignment

# The main focus of this bioinformatics project will be about mapping genetic diversity across geogrpahical regions. 
# This assignment will tackle two key questions 
  1. How are certain genetic traits distributed geographically?
  2. How do geographical barriers influence genetic variation?

# The source of my data is contributed through (https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
